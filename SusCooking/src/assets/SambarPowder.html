                                    <p>Sambar is the queen of curries in South India. A tangy lentil-based dish is cooked with lots of vegetables, mainly okra, eggplant, potatoes, carrots and tomatoes. 
                                        The spicy aromatic sambar is almost like a daily affair in most South Indain households. No matter what, it is a must at hindu weddings, feasts, and other traditional occasions!</p>
