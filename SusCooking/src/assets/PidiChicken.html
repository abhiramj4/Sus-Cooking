                                    <div class="well well-lg" id="summary">
                                        <p class="collapse" id="collapseSummary">
                                        I cannot help writing a bit of a personal story about this dish. I had never seen or heard about pidi until 
                                        I was married to a central Kerala family. 
                                        Even though it happened 22 years back it’s still fresh in my memory how my mother in law made pidi. 
                                        She would wake up in the morning and declare to me “let’s make pidi and chicken today!” And off she got into 
                                        roasting the rice flour in a large and heavy bronze bowl called uruli. <br><br>
            
                                        The roasting was loud with the cast iron spatula hitting the uruli making a dang bang dang sound as she processed it 
                                        like a victorious warrior, taking care not to burn or overdo it! Side by side she would be shouting instructions to the 
                                        maid to get the chicken curry ready and the boiling water ready to knead the dough! <br><br>
            
                                        She then poured the boiling hot water into the flour raking the hot, wet and sticky flour with the noisy spatula again. 
                                        She would then impatiently wait for the dough to cool, in order to knead the dough with hands, 
                                        testing the temperature by poking her finger into it now and then!<br><br>
            
                                        She kneaded the dough ceremoniously which to me looked like it took a lot of strength and aggressive maneuver to 
                                        successfully get the exact texture she needed it to be. If my father in law happen to walk by, of course she would 
                                        coax him to help with that part! <br><br>
            
                                        The next step was to roll the dough into mini balls. She sat on the floor with the dough, stretching her legs
                                         forward leaning against the wall. She grabbed a tiny amount of dough swiftly rolled it between her palms to make 
                                         tiny balls and slid it into the flat bamboo tray called muram, which was more like a dance step! She did it so fast 
                                         like a rolling machine! And I would dare not enter the foray except watch her with my jaws dropping.  <br><br>
            
                                        Now the cooking part she warned me was tricky because the pidi is cooked directly in boiling water! As the pidi got 
                                        cooked she was stirring and tossing it again very ceremoniously till it was done. <br><br>
            
                                        Even though we were only 4 of us in the house she made a huge batch of pidi fearing an aunt would stop 
                                        by during the day or cousins would drop by to say hello! But her most satisfaction came when she plated a 
                                        huge helping of the delicious pidi immersed in thick coconutty rice broth with chicken curry on the side 
                                        and handed it over to me and see me gluttonously gulping it down! 
                                        </p>

                                     Pidi, a soupy rice dumpling dish served with chicken curry is a very traditional dish from the cuisines of Central Kerala. 
                                        <br><br>It is made of rice flour, powdered cumin, crushed shallots and garlic and cooked directly in boiling 
                                        water which then forms into a thick rice broth.
                                        
                                    <h3 align="left" style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Brown rice flour 4 cups</li>
                                    <li>Coconut 2 cups</li>
                                    <li>Cumin dry roasted and powdered 1 tsp</li>
                                    <li>Shallots finely crushed 1 tbsp</li>
                                    <li>Garlic finely crushed 1 tbsp</li>
                                    <li>Salt 2 tsp</li>
                                    <li>Water as required&nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3 align="left" style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Method</strong></h3>
                                    <p>Dry roast the rice flour on medium heat till it starts to change color. About 3 - 4 minutes. Let it cool. In a bowl mix the rice flour, crushed shallot and garlic.</p>
                                    <p>Boil water in a saucepan and add a tsp of salt. Pour the boiling hot water on to the rice flour just enough to make a dough like a roti dough. 
                                        Mix with a spatula. Let it rest till it cools down enough to knead with hands. Knead the dough, make small balls and set aside.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>In a deep dish boil water just enough to cook the rice dumplings.</p>
            
                                    <p>As the water comes to a rolling boil, add a tsp of salt, cumin and coconut. Slowly drop the rice balls into the water.</p>
            
                                    <p>Let it cook for about 10 minutes occasionally stirring the broth with extreme care not to break them apart.</p>
            
                                    <p>Take off heat when the broth thickens, and the dumplings are cooked. Let it cool. Serve with chicken curry!</p>
