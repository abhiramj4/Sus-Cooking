Let the veg mixture totally dry by stir frying on high heat so that they are still crisp and not soggy. Do not cover and cook.</p><p>Place the spring roll sheets on a clean and dry surface. Spread the vege&nbsp;mixture (one tbsp on each) on to the middle of the sheet, roll and close it at the tip with a paste made of water and flour. Keep the rolls covered as you roll them to prevent them from drying. Fry the rolls in a deep fryer. If using fry pan method, pour oil into a frying pan. Make sure you have about one inch of oil level in your frying pan. Fry the rolls and drain on paper towel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
